- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer “bug” was actually a real insect? In 1947,
      when Grace Hopper was working on the Harvard Mark II computer, she discovered a moth stuck in one of the relays.
      She humorously noted it as the “first actual case of a bug” in a computer system. Since then, the term “debugging” has become synonymous with fixing software issues!
